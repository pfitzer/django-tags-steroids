New Tags and Filters
--------------------
1. Create a file in "templatetags" directory named *steroids[thematic].py*
2. Write docblocks for each tag/filter for automatic documentation creation with Sphinx. Look at other
   files for examples.
3. Write unittest for your newly created tags/filters.

Pull Request Process
--------------------

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes and some examples of usage.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is SemVer_.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
